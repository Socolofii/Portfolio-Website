We were required to integrate AI into our workflow so we used it to generate 3D models and the artists refined and optimized the models to help the game run smoother. As programmers, we gave feedback to the artists on which models to focus on optimizing as the AI can sometimes generate too many vertices. This resulted in a much faster workflow where the artists can pump out assets faster than before. </p>

                    <p>- Disguises itself as a chest when spawning.</p>
                    <p>- When the player approaches or when hit, they let out a scream, stunning the player if they are close and waking up</p>
                    <p>- There is a short cooldown when they first spawn where they will not scream if the player is near</p>
                    <p>- When awake, they chase the player and do a melee attack when close enough</p>

                    <p><b>Behaviour</b></p>
                    <p>- A rare and powerful enemy.</p>
                    <p>- When out of melee range, periodically fires 5 fireballs towards the player</p>
                    <p>- Fireballs inflict a burn debuff if it hits the player, dealing damage over time</p>
                    <p>- When in melee range, it swipes twice with its wings, giving the player a bleed debuff</p>
                    <p>- The bleed debuff acts similar to burn, dealing damage over time</p>

                    <p>- As time passes, the difficulty level increases</p>
                    <p>- Chests which drop items cost more to open at higher difficulty levels</p>
                    <p>- Enemies drop more gold at higher difficulty levels</p>
                    <p>- Enemies get a stat boost based on the difficulty</p>
                    <p>- At higher difficulties, more enemies will spawn. Rarer enemies like the dragon will also have a higher chance of spawning per spawn instance</p>
